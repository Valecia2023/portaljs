This is a repo intended to serve as a simple example of a data catalog that get its data from a series of github repos, you can init an example just like this one by.

- Creating a new project with `create-next-app` like so:

```
npx create-next-app <app-name> --example https://github.com/datopian/portaljs/tree/main/ --example-path examples/simple-example
```

- Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

- This project uses the github api, which for anonymous users will cap at 50 requests per hour, so you might want to get a [Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) and add it to a `.env` file inside the folder like so

```
GITHUB_PAT=<github token>
```

- Edit the file `datasets.json` to your liking, some examples can be found inside this [repo](https://github.com/datasets)
- Run the app using:

```
npm run dev
```

Congratulations, you now have something similar to this running on `http://localhost:3000`

## Structure of `datasets.json`

The `datasets.json` file is simply a list of datasets, below you can see a minimal example of a dataset

```json
{
  "owner": "fivethirtyeight",
  "repo": "data",
  "branch": "master",
  "files": ["nba-raptor/historical_RAPTOR_by_player.csv", "nba-raptor/historical_RAPTOR_by_team.csv"],
  "readme": "nba-raptor/README.md"
}
```

It has

- A `owner` which is going to be the github repo owner
- A `repo` which is going to be the github repo name
- A `branch` which is going to be the branch to which we need to get the files and the readme
- A list of `files` which is going to be a list of paths with files that you want to show to the world
- A `readme` which is going to be the path to your data description, it can also be a subpath eg: `example/README.md`

You can also add

- A `description` which is useful if you have more than one dataset for each repo, if not provided we are just going to use the repo description
- A `Name` which is useful if you want to give your dataset a nice name, if not provided we are going to use the junction of the `owner` the `repo` + the path of the README, in the exaple above it will be `fivethirtyeight/data/nba-raptor`
