title: The Open Budget Survey is out
---

Yesterday the [International Budget Partnership](http://internationalbudget.org/) published their [2012 Open Budget Survey](http://survey.internationalbudget.org/#rankings) assessing fiscal transparency across 100 countries. The survey is the most comprehensive of its kind and evaluates countries across 125 questions on everything from the independence of state auditors to the transparency of every step of the budgeting process.  

This year's Open Budget Survey features a [data explorer](http://survey.internationalbudget.org/) developed in collaboration with OKF. Here you are able to compare the performance of countries in the overall score or on any of the specific questions. IBP has conducted the survey every second year since 2006, and therefore it's possible to check if countries have delivered any progress in terns of ranking or score in a neat [timeline](http://survey.internationalbudget.org/#timeline).

The survey also enables you to easily examine a specific country in detail as it provides [data on the assessment of each question of the survey](http://survey.internationalbudget.org/#profile/). So whether you're a researcher, journalist or simply immensely curious the survey should offer plenty of opportunities to dig deep into governmental budgetary transparency.
