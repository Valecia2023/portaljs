Our next community hangout will be on Thursday 14th May at 17:00 BST. If you haven't signed up yet and you'd like to come along, please add your name to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_59aF9SPubHnkLAnGN2cF2Be5ANGqxCJOak4MeAsKJs/edit?usp=drive_web">OpenSpending Hangout Scratchpad</a>.

We're looking for volunteers to give lightning talks and short updates from around the community - if you are interested in giving one on your project or work please just adda note next to your name on the Scratchpad, as above. Anders has kindly volunteered to give a short talk on extractives data but it'd be great to hear from more of you!

The hangout will be via Google Hangout and we'll circulate the link nearer the date.

Looking forward to seeing you there!
