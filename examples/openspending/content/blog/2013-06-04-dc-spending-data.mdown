This weekend thousands of people gathered across United States for a [national day of civic hacking](hackforchange.org). OpenSpending joined organisers at [Code for DC](http://codefordc.org/) in Washington to work on transactional spending data published by the city for 2010 to 2013. The data now allows you to browse spending on [charter schools](http://openspending.org/dc-vendors-contractors/from/public-charter-schools/entries#from:public-charter-schools) and contractors in the [corrections industry](http://openspending.org/dc-vendors-contractors/from/department-of-corrections/entries#from:department-of-corrections).

During Hack for Change we met with journalists and citizens to hear more about what kind of questions that could be answered with the data available. 

If you're interested to learn how you can get spending data from your city onto OpenSpending, get in touch via our [mailing list](http://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/openspending) or [Twiiter](https://twitter.com/openspending).
