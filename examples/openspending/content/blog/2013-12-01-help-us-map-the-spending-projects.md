OpenSpending data is used in projects across the globe by students, journalists, activists, news media, governments, and others. Browse the map to discover some of these exciting projects, and get ideas for your own spending tracking projects.

News Editor <a href="http://www.annaflagg.com">Anna Flagg</a> has now created an upgraded map of spending projects from around the world. The map includes investigative projects, budget monitoring groups and financial transparency initiatives. We need your help to expand the map with some of all the new and fantastic projects out there. Here is a quick guide for how you can add one or more projects in less than five minutes:

1) Go to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/okfn.org/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AqwLVP6U7FhDdEVnaUlLdnRmMnplRzdNWDF3cXBVUmc&usp=drive_web#gid=0">google doc</a> of spending projects, which functions as the "backend" of the map. Ask for approval to become editor in the right corner [the blue coloured "share" button]

2) Add a financial project with information about the country, the URL for the project and other details. If you are unsure about how to add the information, get in touch via the <a href="http://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/openspending">OpenSpending mailing list</a>

3) Share your contribution to the map by tweeting and emailing the mailing list!
