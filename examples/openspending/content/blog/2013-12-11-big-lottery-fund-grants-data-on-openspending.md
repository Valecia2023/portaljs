The Big Lottery Fund have been doing some great strides with [open data](http://okfn.org/opendata/) publishing all of their historical grants data as open data at: <http://www.biglotteryfund.org.uk/research/open-data>

This seemed [perfect for OpenSpending](https://github.com/openspending/datatoload/issues/29) and so with a few minutes of data wrangling we've got the data into OpenSpending (only 2012/2013 data so far):

<https://openspending.org/big-lottery-fund-grants>

You can already get some nice overviews, for example

### By local authority then grantee

Note: this is just 2013 data (not 2012 + 2013)
