At OpenSpending, our restless community drives our work and so our volunteers are key to our activities. Today we are welcoming those joining the News Editors' and Data Wranglers' teams. Find out more about them and what they stand for in the short bios below. Many have already been at work, and you can follow their involvement on <a href="https://trello.com/openspending">our Trello boards</a>.

We will kick-off tonight (lunchtime or breakfast depending on your timezone) with an experiment, a live-blog of the first joint Hangout between the two teams. Tune in at 6pm GMT (or thereabouts).
