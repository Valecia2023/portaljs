Back on April 17 2012 the Northern Mariana Islands Retirement Fund attempted to file for bankruptcy under Chapter 11. There was some pretty interesting reading in their [petition for bankruptcy][petition] including this section (para 10) which suggests some pretty bad public financial management (emphasis added):

[petition]: http://www.nmiretirement.com/downloads/Docket_Files/08_First_Day_Declaration.pdf

> "Debtor has had difficulty maintaining healthy funding levels due to a combination of factors, including: the **failure of the Commonwealth's central government and autonomous agencies to remit full employer contributions**; a difficult investing climate over the most recent three to four years; and **a benefit structure that has been continuously increased and made more generous by the Commonwealth government without a corresponding increase in funding to the Debtor to cover increased costs**."

The Government then made things even worse:

> "These issues have combined to place the fund in a dire financial situation. Compounding this perfect storm, the **Commonwealth Government has passed laws declaring payment holidays, diverting earmarked revenues from the Debtor and reducing contribution rates for the Commonwealth Government, its agencies and political subdivisions**."

And they are now very bankrupt:

> "As a result, as of the date of Debtor's last actuarial report as of October 1, 2009, Debtor's actuary determined that Debtor's obligation was approximately 38.8% funded. While the Debtor is currently engaged in compiling information necessary for an updated actuarial study, the Debtor estimates that it is currently 32% funded. Debtor's financial condition continues to deteriorate, and, by management's figures, the **Debtor will deplete its assets by July, 2014 and thereafter be unable to provide any level of benefits to current and future Beneficiaries**"

Remember what it means when a pension fund goes bankrupt: it means all those people who worked, often for many years, will suddenly receive nothing, often in a period of their life when they most need support.

Note that ultimately Marianas petition for bankdruptcy got refused - as a governmental unit they are not eligible for Chapter 11. More on this and its relation to Puerto Rico situation at <http://www.distressed-debt-investing.com/2013/10/distressed-debt-investing-puerto-rico.html>
