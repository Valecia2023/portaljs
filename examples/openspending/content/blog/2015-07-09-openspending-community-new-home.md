![Migration](/img/blog/2015/07/migration.png)

Welcome to the new OpenSpending Community site!  This site is now
built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).  What does this mean for
you?

> It means that going forward, it should be easier to tweak, update,
  and contribute to the site to better fit the needs of the
  OpenSpending community (e.g. you).

Until recently, this site was hosted using
[Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/).  While Wordpress served its
purpose well, it lacked the degree of flexibility we desired in a
community-oriented site.  Ultimately, we
[chose](https://discuss.okfn.org/t/openspending-community-website-migration-2015/330)
to migrate to GitHub Pages because it gives us the best mix of:

- Ease of deployment and maintenance
- Ease of editing (can do one-click editing and see changes appear)
- Auditable / moderatable
- Configurability and themability

In the process of migrating this site, we also reorganized some of its
content, so please let us know if something is broken or not where it
is supposed to be by creating an issue on the GitHub
[repository](https://github.com/openspending/dotorg/issues/) that hosts this
site.

Contributing is easy and, of course, highly encouraged!  Guidelines
for contributing content to the site are available
[here](http://community.openspending.org/meta/contribute/).
