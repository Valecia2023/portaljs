Every day, government spending makes headlines. At OpenSpending, we want to help the public put the numbers in perspective by showing how the news relates to spending data. **We are looking for volunteers to join our News and Website team to help run our blog and website and connect spending news with data.**

As a member of the News and Web team, you will be involved in things like:

* **Track down "spending stories"** – help find and report on the connections between stories in the media and the world of public finances - government budgets, spending, contracts etc – such as <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-18/detroit-becomes-biggest-u-s-city-to-file-for-bankruptcy.html">Detroit’s bankruptcy</a>. Specifically:
* Collect and share news stories about spending and budgets.
* Find the spending data behind the news stories and write about it on our blog.
* **Edit the Blog**: oversee our blog with latest OpenSpending news including soliciting and editing contributions, writing roundups and news stories and more!
* **Oversee and manage our social media** – Facebook, Twitter etc. Explore new social media outlets (e.g. Tumblr).
* **Resources for journalists**. Write materials to help journalists and citizens dig into spending, understand tax (evasion), or create the next story about the <a href="http://openspending.org/resources/eu/index.html">EU budget</a>

### Qualifications

The most important requirement is enthusiasm! Any experience with, for example, writing stories, editing a blog, running social media is great – but not required!

We have a strong community who will support you and help you grow your skills.

We will provide a short induction on how to work with OpenSpending and you will also have your peers in the News and Website team to help you out.

### What Does it Take?

* Time commitment: ~20-30 minutes a week on average = ~2h a month (note time can be irregular - its fine if you do nothing for a few weeks). Also if you have more time that's great - there's plenty to do!
* When to start: you can start immediately.
* You can also learn more about which tasks you will be doing at the <a href="https://trello.com/b/7E5enK5J/openspending-news-and-website-team">Trello board for the News Team</a>
