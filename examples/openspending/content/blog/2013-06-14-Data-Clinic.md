title: Next Data Clinic 19 June
---

Earlier this month we organised the first OpenSpending Data Clinic, to offer help on how you can work with your budget or spending data. 
At the first clinic we gave feedback on how to format the Canadian budget and how to convert PDFs from the budget of Barcelona.
<br>
The next Data Clinic will be on Wednesday 19 June at 19:00 CET / 18:00 GMT / 13:00 EDT - [your time zone](http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=OpenSpending+Data+Clinic&iso=20130619T13&p1=263&ah=1) via Google Hangout and IRC channel #openspending.
