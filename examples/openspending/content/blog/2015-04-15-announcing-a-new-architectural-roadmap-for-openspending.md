At the 2015 Open Data Day a proposal for a new vision for the approach
and architecture of OpenSpending was approved. It opens up an exciting
opportunity for open budget initiatives around the world to work more
closely together, whilst remaining independent. In a nutshell:

> We want to centralize data but decentralize 'presentation' (views).

What does this mean? It means an OpenSpending ecosystem of smaller
pieces, more loosely joined. It means an OpenSpending to which it is
easier to contribute, in which it is easier to connect your solution
to the global budget data initiative. It means an OpenSpending that is
easier to improve; instead of one monolithic codebase that nobody
wants to touch, it means smaller , more accessible projects that we
hope will inspire your participation. In short, it’s an empowering of
the awesome OpenSpending community which lies at the heart of
everything we do.

You can read the proposal that was accepted in full <a

thanks to Tryggvi and Rufus for working so hard on this. Now over to
you! What do you think? We’d love to hear your thoughts.
