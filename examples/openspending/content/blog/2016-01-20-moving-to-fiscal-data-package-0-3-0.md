After hovering at alpha for a few months, we're looking to move the [Fiscal Data Package](http://fiscal.dataprotocols.org/) specification to version 0.3.0 by 31 January 2016.  

**What does this mean?**

We would like to request interested parties read the [current spec](http://fiscal.dataprotocols.org/)  and raise any comments they have on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/openspending/fiscal-data-package/issues).  We are looking to solve the most pressing issues for a 0.3.0 release.  Please note, that even after the deadline, the specification will still be evolving. As such, comments that don't make the 0.3.0 release could possibly be included in a future release.

In parallel with this, we are seeking to define and refine a process for reviewing and accepting contributions.  Please see the following pull request for details: [#122](https://github.com/openspending/fiscal-data-package/pull/122/files).
