## What's up for discussion?

Last week, we (well, Friedrich) published a straw-man draft of what a standard could look like for transaction level.

The draft is here: <http://openspending.org/resources/standard/index.html>

We're really keen for your thoughts and also to know who we might be able to engage as early adopters in this so please do drop us a line via the [mailing-list](http://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/openspending).
