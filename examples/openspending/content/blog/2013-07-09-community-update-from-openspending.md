This is an update with news from members across the OpenSpending community. We list some of the many ways you can get involved, and we give a status on how registrations are coming along for the <strong>City Spending Data Party</strong> on July 19-21. Hint, we have some great cities participating including Lagos, Minsk and Kathmandu!
