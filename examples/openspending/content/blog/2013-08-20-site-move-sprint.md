We're doing a big move of OpenSpending web content! Most of <http://openspending.org> is moving over to **<http://blog.openspending.org>**, and we need your help to get it there.

We want to make it easier for the community to create and manage OpenSpending's web content. That's why we've created a new WordPress site at <http://blog.openspending.org>. We're going to make it the new home for all community-owned content – everything currently on openspending.org except for the OpenSpending system itself – and rename it **community.openspending.org**. The [help][1] and [about][2] pages have already been moved, with updates.

#### Come help out!

Give us a hand with the move! We're organizing a **site move sprint** for the week of **August 26 - 31**. Here's the plan and how you can get involved:

* Check out the [site content audit spreadsheet][3], which explains what pages exist on the old site (Title, Current URL), what we think should be done with them (Action), where they should go on the new site (Dest URL), and whether anyone has dealt with them yet (Status).
* Please **jump in on the sheet**, mark some items you want to deal with (in the Owner column), and go to it.
* [Add yourself to the move sprint card][4] on the OpenSpending Trello to let us know you're participating.
* If you need access to the WordPress site, please [contact me][5] and I will hook you up.
