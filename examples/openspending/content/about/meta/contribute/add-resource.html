<p>Our resource library is a curated collection open data reosurces from across the community. Everyone can add a resource to the library. This is how to do so.</p>

<h2>1. Add a folder</h2>

<p>Log in to github and head to the following <a href=https://github.com https://github.com/{{ site.github_username }}/tree/gh-pages/resources> link: </a></p>

Every resource has a slug number. To add your resource, you need to give it a number. Look at the list and give you resource the number that follows  the current last number in the list (e.g - if the number is 056, your resource should be named 057).
Click on the + sign in the directory line and add the number and a “/”. For example: 060/.

<h2>2. Add an index file</h2>

<p>Click on the + sign again. Add a file named index.md to your new folder.</p>

<h2>3. Add the resource</h2>

<p>In the text editor, add the front matter fields in this pattern:</p>
