Translating the guide is easy, no need to any other software, all you need is a github account!
Some languages already have translated version of the guide. If you don't have a version in your language, here is how to do it.

<h3> 1. Create a new language folder </h3>

In github, under the breadcrumb - <code>{{ site.github_repo }} / guide/</code>  there will be a '+' sign. Click on it and enter your <a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes >your two letter languages code</a>. Add a dash ('/') after the two letter to create a folder.

<h3> 2. Create a page folder</h3>

Now you will see you languages code and a '+' sign on the breadcrumb. Add a the page name that you want to translate in __English__ and add a dash at the end.

<h3> 3. translate the content</h3>

You will now see a new '+' sign. Add the file name 'index.md'.
In the text editor add the following front matter:
<pre>
---
section: guide
lang: Your language two letter code
title: The title in your language
---
</pre>

Translate as usual.

<h3> 4. Create a pull request</h3>
If all good, we will add it to the site.

Repeat for other parts of the guide if needed.

That's it, you are all done!

Thank you for helping us to make the guide accessiable to others!
