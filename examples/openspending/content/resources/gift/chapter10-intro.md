## Final Observations and Review

The appendix to this report is a consolidated list of projects extracted from the case studies. In addition to this are  other projects, which there was not space to include in the main body of the report, that are however useful examples of tools, approaches and contacts for those interested in fiscal transparency. The list includes the name of the project and the organisation, the geographical focus - where it was implemented as well as the local and national scope, the stage in the fiscal process and the type of technology, link to the tool and a short background. You can access the list [here](http://bit.ly/TTAPF-projects).

We would like to encourage users to help keep this list up to date - if you would like to add a project, please [email us](mailto:gift-report@okfn.org).
