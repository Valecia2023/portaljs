Here we examine projects which track institutional corruption and malpractice. Social auditing, in the sense used here, is when non-governmental organisations or collections of citizens ‘audit’ government projects. There are a wide variety of organisations who engage in this important work around the world. As well as the examples listed below, the appendix provides further examples of technology which has been used to tackle problems similar to the issues facing organisations conducting social audits (which include violence against auditors, outreach and spreading the message and text-message based reports of service delivery).
