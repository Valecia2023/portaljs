In order to assess how much money is available to spend, a government must know how much money it receives. Governments receive revenues in many ways, ranging from taxation to income from natural resources. This section examines tools for transparency regarding revenue and the processes around extractive industries. Transparency around taxation policies is covered in the section on participatory budgeting. 


Case studies include: 

1. [Government of Sierra Leone GoSL](../chapter5-1): Online Repository for Ministry of Mines and Mineral Resources
