## Working Group on Open Spending Data

### Purpose

* Act as a central point of reference and support for people who are interested in open spending data.
* Develop principles for making official and unofficial information about spending legally and technically open
* Document background and status of initiatives to make official information open in different countries
* Support efforts to make spending data discoverable and channels and methods for collaboration around it.
* Work closely with the [Working Group on Open Data in Economics](http://wiki.okfn.org/Working_Groups/Economics) to help contextualise spending and budget data for the purposes of analysis and research.

### Possible activities (to be reviewed)

* Contributing to / providing feedback on  a Spending Data Manual - A wiki-like, community driven manual on acquiring, working with, publishing and archiving spending data, (building on and referencing other works e.g. World Bank's work on budget classifications)
* Keeping their eye-out for new and interesting initiatives springing up around spending and budget data and invite new members to join the discussion
* Help to build up a registry of spending datasets by adding to the [OpenSpending group on the DataHub](http://thedatahub.org/group/openspending)
* Writing blog updates on new developments e.g. new datasets becoming available, updates to laws in your country affecting spending data, new tools to work with, share and collaborate on data
* Considering possibilities for a Spending Data Camp, most likely at or around OGDCamp 2012 with hands-on sessions on licensing, working with and publishing data, aimed at CSOs from around the world.
* ERDF collection.
