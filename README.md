# What is Portal.JS

🌀 Portal.JS is a framework for rapidly building rich data portal frontends using a modern frontend approach. Portal.JS can be used to present a single dataset or build a full-scale data catalog/portal.

Built in JavaScript and React on top of the popular [Next.js](https://nextjs.com/) framework. Portal.JS assumes a "decoupled" approach where the frontend is a separate service from the backend and interacts with backend(s) via an API. It can be used with any backend and has out of the box support for [CKAN](https://ckan.org/).

## Features

- 🗺️ Unified sites: present data and content in one seamless site, pulling datasets from a DMS (e.g. CKAN) and content from a CMS (e.g. Wordpress) with a common internal API.
- 👩‍💻 Developer friendly: built with familiar frontend tech (JavaScript, React, Next.js).
- 🔋 Batteries included: full set of portal components out of the box e.g. catalog search, dataset showcase, blog, etc.
- 🎨 Easy to theme and customize: installable themes, use standard CSS and React+CSS tooling. Add new routes quickly.
- 🧱 Extensible: quickly extend and develop/import your own React components
- 📝 Well documented: full set of documentation plus the documentation of Next.js and Apollo.

### For developers

- 🏗 Build with modern, familiar frontend tech such as JavaScript and React.
- 🚀 Next.js framework: so everything in Next.js for free: Server Side Rendering, Static Site Generation, huge number of examples and integrations, etc.
  - Server Side Rendering (SSR) => Unlimited number of pages, SEO and more whilst still using React.
  - Static Site Generation (SSG) => Ultra-simple deployment, great performance, great lighthouse scores and more (good for small sites)

## What happened to Recline?

Portal.JS used to be Recline(JS). If you are looking for the old Recline codebase it still exists:  see the [`recline` branch](https://github.com/datopian/portal.js/tree/recline). If you want context for the rename see [this issue](https://github.com/datopian/portal.js/issues/520).
