## What is MarkdownDB?

MarkdownDB can parse your markdown files, extract structured data, such as frontmatter, tags, back- and forward links, and create an index in a local SQLite database. It also provides a lightweight JavaScript API for querying the database and importing files into your application. With MarkdownDB, you have a powerful tool that allows you to efficiently query your markdown data.

## What you're going to learn

This tutorial guides you through the steps of creating SQLite database of our GitHub projects, using markdown files and MarkdownDB package. In addition, it demonstrates how to write a simple script to query a database for the projects and display them in an attractive format on the terminal.

Key highlights from the tutorial include:

1. Creating markdown files with some basic information for each GH project.
2. Indexing markdown files into an SQLite database.
3. Exploring the SQLite database using SQLite viewer or in the command line.
4. Querying the database in a simple Node.js app and displaing them in the terminal.
5. Adding metadata, like name, numbers of stars or number of forks, to project files.
6. Pretty printing the output in the terminal.

By the end of the tutorial, you'll have a simple catalog of a few of our GitHub projects using markdown files and the MarkdownDB package.
